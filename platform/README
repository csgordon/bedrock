For a nice web server demo, set environment variable PAGES to the path
of a directory whose contents you want to serve (recursively) as
static web files.  Then, run the following, ideally with parallel
'make'.  Expect the whole build process to last several hours.  (And
all this has only been tested in amd64 Linux and definitely won't work
on other hardware ISAs.)

make -C ../src
# Base Bedrock library
make
# Platform examples
make tests/pages.gen.s
# Encode static content into an assembly file.
make tests/WebServer.exe
# Build server executable.
# Now the server is accessible on port 8080 of localhost.
